    "A well-known problem with large language models (LLMs) is that they make things up. These are sometimes called 'hallucinations' but a safer (and less anthropomorphic) term is 'ungrounded addition' - something in the text which cannot be firmly established. When attempting to establish whether or not something in an LLM response is 'true' we can either check for it in the supplied prompt (this is called 'narrow grounding') or use our general knowledge ('broad grounding'). Note that narrow grounding can lead to things being classified as 'true, but ungrounded.' For example \"I live in Switzerland\" is **not** _narrowly_ grounded in \"I live in Geneva\" even though it must be true (it **is** _broadly_ grounded).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we run a simple grounding pipeline, to see if a summary text has any ungrounded additions as compared to the original, and use this information to improve the summary text. This can be done in three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a list of the entities in the summary text\n",
    "1. Check to see if these entities appear in the original (grounding) text\n",
    "1. Remove the ungrounded entities from the summary text\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an 'entity' in this context? In its simplest form, it's a named object such as a person or place (so 'Dean' or 'Seattle'). However, the idea could be a _claim_ which relates concepts (such as 'Dean lives near Seattle'). In this notebook, we will keep to the simpler case of named objects.\n"

    "to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out,\n",

    "he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in\n",
    "inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took\n",
    "so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n",

    "and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him;\n",

    "a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered\n",
    "the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the\n",
    "interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years\n",
